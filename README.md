This Python program is an Einstein Puzzle solver that systematically explores all possible solutions to a logic-based grid puzzle while adhering to given constraints. It begins by taking user input for the puzzle dimensions (an m×n grid) and a set of relational rules (e.g., "X must be next to Y" or "A cannot be in the same column as B"). The solver then constructs a tree of possible configurations, where each node represents a partially completed grid state, and uses breadth-first search (BFS) to explore valid moves while enforcing constraints through a validation function. The program identifies all complete, rule-compliant solutions by traversing to the deepest level of the tree. Additionally, it offers an interactive mode where users can attempt to solve the puzzle manually, receiving real-time feedback on their moves, or request hints derived from the solver’s valid paths. If no solutions exist, the program detects this and notifies the user. Designed for terminal use, it combines backtracking, constraint propagation, and tree traversal to efficiently tackle classic logic puzzles like the Einstein Riddle, providing both educational and practical problem-solving insights.
